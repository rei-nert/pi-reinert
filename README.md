# POST-INSTALL SCRIPT

My personal post-install script, distro agnostic, to
create a productive environment.
It should detect which distro family it's running on. 
It should also download a DE/WM, install eyecandy, terminal emulator, enable security
programs, etc. 
Also, it will download my config file and myscripts.
Everything is modular, so it's possible to change almost everything.
